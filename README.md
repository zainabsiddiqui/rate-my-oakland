RateMyOakland is a Google Chrome extension that displays RateMyProfessors ratings on the Oakland University online registration system. It streamlines the registration process most students go through. 

It works by grabbing professor names from the results of a SAIL course search and searching for them on RateMyProfessors.com. If found, the professor's overall rating and other information is injected back into the course search webpage under the professor's name.
