RateMyOakland is a Google Chrome extension that displays RateMyProfessors ratings on the Oakland University online registration system. It streamlines the registration process most students go through. 

It works by grabbing professor names from the results of a SAIL course search and searching for them on RateMyProfessors.com. If found, the professor's overall rating and other information is injected back into the course search webpage under the professor's name.

## Disclaimer

RateMyOakland does not guarantee the accuracy of the reviews and ratings on RateMyProfessors.com. It only displays them. Register at your own risk.

* Not all professors (especially newer ones) at Oakland University have a page on RateMyProfessors.com, so they cannot have ratings.
